a robust model fit.

this plot, we can see the odds ratios vary significantly among cities,
suggesting that the likelihood of solving homicides involving male
victims relative to female victims depends on the city. In most cities,
the odds ratios are less than 1, implying that male victims are less
likely to have their cases solved compared to female victims. A few
cities, such as Stockton, CA, and Minneapolis, MN, show extremely high
ORs with large confidence intervals, possibly indicating unique local
factors or outlier cases influencing the results.
